<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Hi, I'm [Remy Lambert](https://github.com/remlamb?tab=repositories) and this is a technical presentation of my Networking project made during my 2nd years of the game devellopement Bachelor at the SAE Geneve.<br>
The aim was to create a real time online game in a month, using a rollback system to keep the simulation identical for each client. <br>
</div>

## **Introduction: **
<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
The aim of this project was to create a <B>real time online game</B> in a month.<br>
This come with a lot of system to manage and solution to find. <br>
Like how to send custently and as <B>fast</B> as possible data between player? Here <B>thanks to UDP</B> for clients communications.<br>
Or even how to keep our <B>simulation the same between 2 clients</B> with data lost? By implementing a <B>rollback system</B> for our world.<br>
</div>

## **Preview of the Game:**
<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
  ### <B>Technical Direction:</B>
  <div style="margin-left: 20px;">


    To create a <B>window</B> and manage the <B>graphics</B> and <B>audio</B>, I chose the <B>[Raylib library](https://www.raylib.com/).</B>  <br>
    I chose it partially because it's fairly popular, so you can find help and resources quite easily, and the documentation is well detailed.<br>
    But above all for its <B>cross-platform</B> advantage, my ultimate goal being to be able to port the game to the web using emscripten. <br>


For the <B>Network</B> part of my game I use the <B>[Photon library](https://www.photonengine.com/)</B>  .<br>
It provides <B>free servers</B>, an integrated <B>lobby</B> system and internal management of data transfers between clients.<br>

For the <B>physics</B> and collision management, I used <B>my own engine</B>. <B>[the Miaou Engine](https://github.com/remlamb/MiaouEngine)</B> <br>
It's <B>easier to manage the physics</B> on my minimalist engine, but it's more than enough for a 2D game of this scale. <br>
This simplicity is a strong point for <B>being able to replicate the world in the rollback system</B>.<br>

  ### <B>Game:</B>
  <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
Here are the final render of my game.<br>
     - add gif -  <br>
My objective was to create a game based on versus, with a small scope but a<B> simple dynamic and fun gameplay</B>.<br>
I went for a 2d game with only lateral movement, a jump and an attack.<br>
The game distinguishes itself by this last mechanism, you can only attack downwards.<br>
The attack is a projectile which, once on the ground, acts as a killing obstacle in the same way as in classic platformer game.<br>
In the end, the game is a <B>mix of platformer and versus.</B><br>

### <B>Networking: </B>
<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
  Client, create join room, Send inputs, receive, → Definir achitecture pour expliquer comment on l a exploité<br>

<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
### <B>Rollback: </B>
<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
  Current frame,
Confirm frame (last frame valid),
resimulate world si rollback,
Stock des inputs tant que current frame non validé,
checksum pour l intégrité du world physique<br>

    ## **Conclusion:**
    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
      First of all, <B>thank you</B> for reading.  <br>

      As mentioned earlier, the next stage of the project is the<B> web port</B>, to make the game easier to play. <br>
      Otherwise the <B>rollback system</B> is a very powerful tool for keeping the <B>simulation identical</B> in the event of data loss. It's a good solution for <B>a project of this scale</B>, but may be too <B>expensive for larger projects</B>. <br>
