                          **Miaou Engine DevBlog :**

Hi, I'm [Remy Lambert](https://github.com/remlamb?tab=repositories) and this is a short DevBlog of my physics engine called Miaou Engine
which I made during my games programming formation at the [SAE School](https://www.sae.edu/ch-ge/games-programming-diploma-bachelor).



## **What's the goal of the Engine ?**

!!! Note: Goal :
    * Recap of linear algebra
    * Understand the basics of physics
    * Use Tracy to track the performance of our code
    * Understand where and how to optimise code


## **Availble Demo Scene**
<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
### Planets Scene
<div style="text-align:center;">
![](img\planet.gif)</div>
<br><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<i>  The Planets Scene provides a visual representation of the interaction between celestial bodies, illustrating the influence of gravitational forces on planetary motion. <br>
The yellow star in the centre represents the sun, the other points are the planets.
</i>
</div>

### Trigger Scene
<div style="text-align:center;">
![](img\trigger.gif)</div>
<br><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<i> The Trigger Scene provides a visual representation of trigger collisions and their effects on object properties. <br>
Here objects will change colour depending on whether they overlap or not. Red means they do not overlap and green means they do.</i>

### Collision Scene
<div style="text-align:center;">
![](img\collision.gif)</div>
<br><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
 <i> The Collision Scene provides a practical illustration of collision detection and response in a 2D world using a QuadTree. <br>
Collision response mean that Circles adapt their velocity after the contact with an other Circles. <br>
Also two circles that collide will take on the same new color.</i>
</div>

### Collision between Circle and Rectangle Scene
<div style="text-align:center;">

<br><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
 <i>The Collision between Circle and Rectangle Scene provides a practical illustration of collision detection and response in a 2D world using a QuadTree. <br>
Scene is showcasing the interaction between different entities shapes.<br>
Two objects that collide will take on the same new color.</i>

</div>

### Static Scene
<div style="text-align:center;">
![](img\static.gif)</div>
<br><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<i> The Static Scene provides a practical illustration of collision detection and response in a 2D world with static and dynamic elements. <br>
Circles adapt their velocity into contact with the static Rectangle, Contact response is based on the collider restitution.</i>
</div>
</div>

## **Contact Detection**
<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
### Naive implementation
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  The naive implementation of detecting contact between elements was to compare each element created with the other elements. <br>
  This was very costly as we were checking for collisions that were clearly impossible, for example if 2 elements were on opposite sides of the window.
  </div>

### What's a QuadTree ?
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  The quadtree will divide the world into 4 smaller quads, where there is more chance to have collisions only between the elements in the new quad.<br>
  The time complexity of the problem will go through O(n) -> Olog(n) with this method as we divided the space for possible collision.<br>
  To avoid a problem where an object can be in the 4 new quad, we put it in the root position.<br>
  We use this system in recursion to reduce the possible pair we want to find, we set a depth element to control the max subdivision in quad we want to have. <br>

We used a simplified version of the collider to get information about the position of each collider in the world. <br>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  struct SimplifedCollider
      {
          Engine::ColliderRef colliderRef;
          Math::RectangleF aabb;
      };
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  <br>

A Node has an array of children, and a vector (AllocatedVector here for memory tracking, which we'll see later) of the colliders present in the Node.
<br>

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  struct QuadNode
    {
        ...
        std::array<QuadNode*, 4> children{nullptr, nullptr, nullptr, nullptr};
        AllocatedVector<SimplifedCollider> colliders{};
        ...
    };
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  <br>

  The tree has a node vector and a possible pair vector which is filled in after the tree is created during the frame.Then the nodes are traversed to determine whether colliders can collide.    <br>
  There is also a limit to the number of colliders possible in a node before it is subdivided, as well as a limit to the depth, meaning the number of sudivisions possible from node 0, which we call root.
    <br>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    class QuadTree
      {
          ...
          AllocatedVector<QuadNode> nodes{StandardAllocator<QuadNode>{heapAllocator}};
          AllocatedVector <ColliderPair> nodeColliderPairs{
                  StandardAllocator <ColliderPair > {heapAllocator}};

          static const auto MaxColliderInNode = 4;
          static const auto MaxDepth = 6;
          ...
        };
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  </div>
### Frame Analysis
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
We can use Tracy to compare frame times with and without the quadtree.
  ![Tracy Stats without Quadtree](img\withoutQuad.png)
  ![Tracy Stats with Quadtree](img\withQuad.png)

Tracy already gives us the mean, median and standard deviation of the target function.<br>
Here we've taken the part where we calculate the possible pairs with the quadtree created earlier.<br>
I've chosen this section rather than the whole Update part, to highlight the area of the code we're trying to optimise.<br>
You can see that all the stats have been reduced.<br><br>

I also ran a t-test to look more closely at the statistics for this part of the optimisation.<br>
<i>For a total of 200 elements for each population we got : </i><br>


ResolveNarrowPhase | WithoutQuadTree | WithQuadTree  |
  ------------------|-----------------|---------------|
 Mean (ns)          |     36852,34171 |   10541,89447 |
 Variance (ns)      |       134053595 |   27894466,13 |

 <i>Note : We can see variation between this mean and the one in the tracy screen because i used a different record for both.</i><br>
 For the T-test we need to see if our P(T <= t) two-tail is lower than our p set at 5%

 ResolveNarrowPhase |  |
   ------------------|-----------------|
P(T<=t) two-tail          |     2,76668853343804E-86 |
t Critical two-tail      |       1,96859628388271 |

As this is true we can calculate some new stats that show our optimisation with the test

ResolveNarrowPhase  |                  |
  ------------------|-----------------|
 MeanDifference (ns)|     26310,44724 |
 StandardError (ns) |     902,1138246 |
 ErrorMargin (ns)   |     1775,897923 |

 ResolveNarrowPhase : Limit Confidence    |                  |
   ------------------|-----------------|
  LowerLimit (ns)    |     24534,54931 |
  Greater Limit (ns) |     27212,56106 |

Mean difference represents the time in average that we gain each frame with this optimisation.

### Memory Problem ?
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
!!! Error: Memory Leak
    A quick aside on an huge error I made. <br>
    When I implemented my quad tree I used this array of ptr in the quad node struct.<br>
    In the Subdivide function I used to call new operator in order to create the children of
    each node.<br>

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    struct QuadNode
        {
            ...
              std::array<QuadNode*, 4> children{};
            ...
            void Subdivide();
        };
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    <br>
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    void Subdivide()
    {
      ...
          children[0] = new QuadNode(Math::RectangleF(leftMiddle, topMiddle));;
          children[1] = new QuadNode(Math::RectangleF(center, topRightCorner));;
          children[2] = new QuadNode(Math::RectangleF(bottomLeftCorner, center));;
          children[3] = new QuadNode(Math::RectangleF(bottomMiddle, rightMiddle));;
    }
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


    As I don't delete the ptr I create a huge Memory Leak : <br> <br>
    ![Programme memory used at start](img\0sMemoryLeak.png)
    ![Programme memory after 10s](img\10sMemoryLeak.png)

    Every frame I called up a new operator, which is why the memory kept growing.<br>
    I first fixed it with a single ptr.<br>

  </div>
      ### Memory Tracking
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        For the part where we create the children of the nodes, I opted for another solution in the end.<br>
        Instead of allocating memory for children when we create a new node, I create all the possible node, and so chlidren, in the first frame of the program using a simple function that calls
         the depth limit that we created beforehand<br>

         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
           std::size_t maxChildrenPossible = 0;
          for(int i = 0; i <= MaxDepth; i++)
          {
              maxChildrenPossible += Math::Pow(4, i);
          }
          nodes.resize(maxChildrenPossible, QuadNode({heapAllocator}));
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         In Tracy that represents this memory pattern at the start of the program.<br>

         ![InitTreeMemory](img\initTree.png)

         Unfortunately I forgot to take a screen of the update pattern without the allocation in the init, but the difference was that there were also allocations for the new nodes. <br>
         Now it looks like This :<br>


        ![UpdateMemory](img\updateMemory.png)

        the allocations at the start of the frame are due to the colliders added to the collider vectors of the nodes. <br>

        Allocations in the narrow phase represent movements between pairs that are currently in contact or not, and are stored in an unordered_set. <br>
        Pairs are added to the set if there is a collision and removed from it if the collision has ended. <br>

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            //THIS IS PSEUDO-CODE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO READ.
              for (auto &pair: ColliderPairsFromQuadTree)
             {
                ...
                 const auto pairIterator = unordered_setOfColliderPairs.find(pair);
                 if (pairIterator !=  unordered_setOfColliderPairs.end())
                 {
                     if (IsContact(colliderA, colliderB))
                     {
                       ...
                         contact.Resolve();
                     }
                     else
                     {
                         OnTriggerExit Or OnCollisionExit
                         //HERE WE REMOVE A PAIR FROM THE unordered_set
                         unordered_setOfColliderPairs.erase(pairIterator);
                     }
                 }
                 else{
                     if(IsContact(colliderA, colliderB))
                     {
                        ...
                        contact.Resolve();
                        OnTriggerEnter Or OnCollisionEnter
                        //HERE WE ADD A PAIR IN THE unordered_set
                        unordered_setOfColliderPairs.insert(pair);
                     }
                 }
             }
